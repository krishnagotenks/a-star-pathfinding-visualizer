# A* Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is an interactive A* Pathfinding Visualizer built using Python and Tkinter. The application allows users to visually observe how the A* search algorithm finds the shortest path between two points on a grid, avoiding obstacles along the way.

## Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Users can create start and end points, draw barriers, and watch the A* algorithm find the shortest path.
- **Optimized Performance**: The visualizer is designed to handle large grids efficiently, with clear pathfinding animations.
- **Modular Code Structure**: The project is organized into separate modules for better readability and maintainability.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/krishnagotenks/a-star-pathfinding-visualizer.git
   cd a-star-pathfinding-visualizer
2. **Install dependencies:**
   **Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required libraries:**

     ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
3.  **Run the application:**

     ```sh
       python main.py
## Usage

- **Left Click**: Place the start point, end point, or barriers on the grid.
- **Right Click**: Remove barriers, start, or end points.
- **Space Bar**: Start the pathfinding algorithm.
- **C Key**: Clear the grid and reset the board.
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to create a pull request.
